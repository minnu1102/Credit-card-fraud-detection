Project Name: Fraud Detection System – AI-Driven Credit Card Fraud Detection

Problem Statement:
Financial institutions need to catch fraudulent credit card transactions quickly and accurately. This project identifies potentially fraudulent transactions in real time to protect both consumers and companies.

Objectives:
• Automate fraud detection and reduce manual reviews.
• Improve detection recall while minimizing false alerts.
• Build a scalable and explainable ML pipeline for future integration.

Data & Input:
• Input: Historical credit card transaction records (284,000+ samples).
• Features include transaction amount, timestamp, customer info, etc.
• Target: Fraudulent (1) or Legitimate (0) transactions.

Technologies Used:
• Python for development
• XGBoost for high-performance classification
• SMOTE for balancing imbalanced datasets
• PCA for reducing feature dimensions
• K-Means for clustering high-risk profiles
• Pandas/NumPy for data processing and pipeline creation

System Workflow:

Load and clean transaction data using Pandas.

Address class imbalance with SMOTE.

Reduce feature space using PCA.

Train XGBoost model.

Cluster using K-Means to segment risk categories.

Evaluate results and store model for further use.

Model Choice & Reasoning:
• XGBoost was selected for its speed and accuracy on structured data.
• SMOTE was used to ensure the model learns to identify fraud, despite rarity.
• PCA helped improve model performance by removing noise and reducing overfitting.
• K-Means clustering added an explainable layer by grouping transactions into risk profiles.

Performance Optimization:
• Fraud detection recall improved from 72% to 86%.
• False positives reduced by 25% using clustering-based risk thresholds.
• PCA reduced input features by 50%, speeding up training and inference.

Deployment Readiness:
• Modular code structure supports deployment via REST API or batch pipeline.
• Model artifacts can be saved using joblib or pickle for production integration.
• Pipeline design supports future scaling and containerization.

Key Results:
• Achieved 86% recall with significantly fewer false positives.
• Pipeline successfully handles large datasets with fast processing time (~seconds per batch).

Future Improvements:
• Automate model retraining using streaming data pipelines.
• Export model as microservice using FastAPI and Docker.
• Implement real-time alert dashboard and risk scoring UI for business users.
